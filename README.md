## Running Unit Tests
All of our unit tests are located in the `tests` folder under the root directory. To run the entire unit test suite, `cd` into `tests` and execute `./run_tests.sh`.
Remember that you may need to grant file permissions to the test execution script with something like `chmod +x run_tests.sh`.
